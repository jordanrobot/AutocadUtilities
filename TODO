Structure:

-look at OL behavior when layer 1 is active, a layer 2 object is selected, and then cst is run.  Does this set layer 1 as OL, or layer 2?  Perhaps this would be a desirable thing.  It would make selecting the OL much easier (at the cost of confusing people even more?).

-make color user settable?

Commands:

-change commands to use ` key?
	--I don't think it's assigned to anything by default.
	--Good use of pinky, rolling towards the spacebar.
	--construct - `
	--destruct - ``e
		---note: double `, or a confirmation dialogue to prevent unanticipated deletions?  perhaps a visual indicator of what will be deleted?  or just stick to the the mighty undo?

-copy to constructions command: `c
-move to constructions command: `v or `m or ``c

-copy from constructions command? (& move from)
	--I'm on the fence about this.  would it encourage sloppy use?  
	--Ideally they should just toggle over to OL and create the object there.
	--then again, it would increase flexibility.
	--Probably need more real use testing before deciding.

-isolate constructions command: `s?

-toggle constructions layer on/off: `t? `h? `f?

-toggle constructions printing property?: low low priority.

-Destroy constructions
	--give a reminder/visual indication of what you're deleting
	--(maybe this stuff isn't such a good idea, prolly just cruft)
