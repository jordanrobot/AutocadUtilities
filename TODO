Bugs:
	dst (laydel) pops up text window when deleting blocks or dimensions.  Rewrite using cst_clean & purge command
	cannot purge after dimensions have been created on that layer.!!!!

Structure:

-change crosshair color back to dynamic, not hardcoded
-make crosshair color a decision tree


---
Commands:

TODO: modify cst - turn layer on if off


-copy from constructions command? (& move from)
	--I'm on the fence about this.  would it encourage sloppy use?  
	--Ideally they should just toggle over to OL and create the object there.
	--then again, it would increase flexibility.
	--Probably need more real use testing before deciding.

-Destroy constructions
	--give a reminder/visual indication of what you're deleting?????
	--(maybe this stuff isn't such a good idea, prolly just cruft)
