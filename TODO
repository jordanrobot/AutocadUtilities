Bugs:
	dst (laydel) pops up text window when deleting blocks or dimensions.  Rewrite using cst_clean & purge command

-change commands to use ` key?

		---note: double `, or a confirmation dialogue to prevent unanticipated deletions?  perhaps a visual indicator of what will be deleted?  or just stick to the the mighty undo?

-copy to constructions command: x` or r` or cc`?
-move to constructions command: x` or m`

-copy from constructions command? (& move from)
	--I'm on the fence about this.  would it encourage sloppy use?  
	--Ideally they should just toggle over to OL and create the object there.
	--then again, it would increase flexibility.
	--Probably need more real use testing before deciding.

-isolate constructions command: s`

-toggle constructions layer on/off: t` or h` or f`
